## Design Principles
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: The project is divided into `Domain`, `Application`, `Infrastructure`, and `Interface` layers.
- **Repositories Pattern**: All database access is abstracted through repositories.
- **Separation of concerns**: Each layer has a well-defined responsibility.
- **Testability**: Each component is independently testable.
