# Project Overview

## Introduction

This backend dashboard project is built using NestJS, implementing Clean Architecture principles and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) patterns. It serves as a robust foundation for building scalable, maintainable, and secure web applications.

## Architecture

The project follows a layered architecture based on Clean Architecture principles:

### 1. Domain Layer (`/domain`)

- Contains enterprise business rules and entities
- Independent of other layers
- Includes:
  - Entities
  - Value Objects
  - Domain Events
  - Repository Interfaces
  - Domain Services

### 2. Application Layer (`/application`)

- Contains application business rules
- Orchestrates the flow of data and implements use cases
- Includes:
  - Use Cases/Services
  - Commands and Queries (CQRS)
  - DTOs
  - Event Handlers
  - Interfaces for external services

### 3. Infrastructure Layer (`/infrastructure`)

- Contains implementations of interfaces defined in inner layers
- Handles external concerns
- Includes:
  - Repository Implementations
  - External Service Implementations
  - Database Configuration
  - ORM Entities
  - Third-party Integrations

### 4. Interface Layer (`/interface`)

- Contains adapters for incoming requests
- Handles HTTP concerns
- Includes:
  - Controllers
  - Middleware
  - Request/Response DTOs
  - API Documentation

## Key Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Refresh token rotation
- Token blacklisting
- Password hashing with bcrypt

### Store Management

- Store creation and configuration
- Product management
- Category management
- Review system
- Progress tracking

### Admin Features

- User management
- Store approvals
- System monitoring
- Analytics and reporting

### Technical Features

- TypeScript for type safety
- CQRS pattern for complex operations
- Event-driven architecture
- Comprehensive logging
- Error handling
- Request validation
- API documentation with Swagger
- Unit and integration tests
- Database migrations
- Environment-based configuration

## Design Patterns

### 1. Repository Pattern

- Abstracts data persistence
- Enables swapping data sources
- Centralizes data access logic

### 2. CQRS Pattern

- Separates read and write operations
- Enables optimization for different operations
- Supports event sourcing

### 3. Factory Pattern

- Creates complex objects
- Centralizes object creation logic
- Enables dependency injection

### 4. Strategy Pattern

- Used for interchangeable algorithms
- Enables runtime behavior changes
- Examples: authentication strategies, file storage strategies

### 5. Observer Pattern

- Implements event-driven architecture
- Enables loose coupling
- Used for domain events

## Security Measures

1. Authentication

   - JWT tokens with expiration
   - Refresh token rotation
   - Token blacklisting
   - Rate limiting

2. Authorization

   - Role-based access control
   - Resource-based permissions
   - Guard-based protection

3. Data Protection

   - Password hashing
   - Input validation
   - Output sanitization
   - CORS configuration

4. API Security
   - Rate limiting
   - Request validation
   - Error handling
   - Security headers

## Performance Optimizations

1. Caching

   - Response caching
   - Query result caching
   - Cache invalidation strategies

2. Database

   - Query optimization
   - Index management
   - Connection pooling

3. Application
   - Compression
   - Clustering
   - Load balancing
   - Memory management

## Monitoring and Logging

1. Logging

   - Request/response logging
   - Error logging
   - Performance metrics
   - Audit trails

2. Monitoring
   - Health checks
   - Performance monitoring
   - Error tracking
   - Usage analytics

## Future Enhancements

1. Features

   - Two-factor authentication
   - OAuth integration
   - Real-time notifications
   - Advanced analytics

2. Technical

   - GraphQL API
   - WebSocket support
